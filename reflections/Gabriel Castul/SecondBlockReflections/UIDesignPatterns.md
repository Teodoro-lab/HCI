During the process of selecting a toolkit/guidelines it is important to verify if basic UI patterns are present. 
>Select a task (team project) of your UI/prototype designed so far. Define a relevant UI pattern, and determine if it was applied or it should be. Either case, describe a specific implementation of the UI pattern and the relevance of it based on project's usability goals.

In our chat bot project, we used the Form pattern to allow mentees to schedule appointments with mentors. The bot presented a form with input fields for date, time, location, and any additional notes. Labels were used to indicate the purpose of each field, and the form was structured in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.

The use of the Form pattern was essential to our project's usability goals because it allowed users to input their appointment details quickly and easily. By using a structured and organized layout, the Form pattern made it clear what information was required and how to input it. This helped to reduce errors and streamline the appointment scheduling process for both mentees and mentors.

Overall, the Form pattern was a relevant and effective UI design pattern for our chat bot project, as it helped to organize and present information in a clear and user-friendly manner, facilitating the scheduling of mentoring sessions.
