> The concepts of UI and UX frequently are misunderstood and misused. Using as reference the following article: "[UX vs UI: Whatâ€™s the Difference? (And How They Apply to WordPress)](https://wpmudev.com/blog/ux-ui-wordpress/ "https://wpmudev.com/blog/ux-ui-wordpress/")" provide a clear difference between the concepts. Use two examples based on your team project to clarify each concepts. The examples of UI and UX must be specific and clearly explained.

**UI**: Its the visual design and layout of a product

**UX**: Encompasses the overall experience and satisfaction of the user when interacting with the product
  
The examples that I would make for my team project are:

**UI example**: The design of the chat bot's interface is clean and intuitive, with well-labeled and logically organized navigation. The color scheme is consistent and pleasant to look at across all of the bot's features. The font size and style are easy to read, and the buttons are appropriately spaced and responsive.

**UX example**: After a mentee schedules a session with a mentor through the chat bot, a confirmation message is sent to them that includes the appointment's details such as the date, time, and platform of the meeting. Additionally, the message contains a reminder for the mentee to arrive on time and a link that can be used to cancel or reschedule the appointment if needed. This feedback is designed to be helpful and considerate of the user's needs, creating a positive experience when using the chat bot.
