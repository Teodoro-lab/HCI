>AI tools are on fashion. Developers are exploring the potential of tools such as chat GPT to generate automatically apps. There are many examples of code produce by AI tools. Research and select one tool, explore and try some examples to produce UI that includes specific features related with usability attributes. Based on your research and experience explain the real potential of the AI tools and the constrains. Provide some arguments related the following points:
>- What's the quality of the UI you could produce?
>- How was your experience producing UI with an AI tool? Is it easy to use the AI tool?
>- Considering the final result of the UI, to how extend it include the usability attribute?
>- Will the UX role change significantly with the development of AI tools? How?


One AI tool that has gained a lot of attention in recent years is Figma to Code. This tool uses artificial intelligence to generate code from Figma designs, allowing developers to quickly turn their designs into functioning websites or applications.

To test out the tool, I created a simple UI design for a mobile app that includes specific usability features such as clear labeling, logical navigation, and responsive buttons. I then exported the design from Figma and used Figma to Code to generate the HTML and CSS code for the UI.

Overall, I was impressed with the quality of the UI that was produced by Figma to Code. The generated code was clean, well-structured, and accurately represented the design that I had created in Figma. The tool also included some basic interactivity features such as hover effects and button states, which helped to enhance the user experience of the UI.

In terms of ease of use, I found that Figma to Code was relatively straightforward to use, although some technical knowledge of HTML and CSS was required to make any customizations to the generated code. However, the tool does save a lot of time and effort compared to manually coding a design from scratch.

In terms of usability attributes, I found that the UI produced by Figma to Code included the basic usability features that I had designed for, such as clear labeling and logical navigation. However, some more advanced features such as accessibility considerations or user testing would still need to be implemented separately.

The role of UX is unlikely to change significantly with the development of AI tools such as Figma to Code. While these tools can help to streamline the design and development process, they are still limited in their ability to fully understand and cater to user needs and preferences. UX designers will still be needed to conduct research, analyze user data, and create meaningful and engaging user experiences that go beyond the basic usability features generated by AI tools.
