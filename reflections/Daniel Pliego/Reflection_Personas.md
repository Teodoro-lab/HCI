> Personas has become a relevant method to design products. Regular methods and techniques for designing products are based on functional features and demographic data of users. 
> However, Personas is focused on provide a deeper understanding of the user based on usersâ€™ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals. 
> Consider your team's project and based on the Personas Toolkit and Lene Nielsen template (both provided on resources section) choose one category (needs, experiences, behaviors and goals) and explain the following:

> What are specifics items of the toolkit selected for collecting? Why are relevant for your project?
> What was the method to collect the items? What's the method to analise and syntetise the data for an specific item?
> Explain a specific example of the use of how it will be the influence or the impact Personas on the product.

For the team project, the category chosen from the Personas Toolkit is "Behaviors".

The specific items of the toolkit selected for collecting are:

- Routines: Collecting information on how often students study or tutor, and when they prefer to study, can help design a platform that accommodates their schedules.
- Goals: Understanding what students hope to achieve by tutor or being tutored can help design features that help them reach their goals.
- Motivations: Understanding what motivates students to tutor or learn from others can help design a platform that provides the right incentives and rewards.
- Attitudes: Collecting information on how students feel about tutoring or learning from others can help design features that address their concerns or challenges.

The method to collect the items was through surveys and interviews. The survey was sent to students interested in using a platform to have tutoring sessions with another students. Interviews were conducted to gather more in-depth information and to observe students of different semesters.

A specific example of the use and impact of Personas on the product could be to create a "tutor persona" and a "learner persona" based on the information collected from the Behaviors category. These personas would be used as a reference for designing features that meet the needs and goals of each persona. For example, the "tutor persona" may prefer to use the platform during specific times of the day and may be motivated by rewards or recognition for their tutoring efforts. In contrast, the "learner persona" may be more interested in finding specific topics or subjects to learn and may be motivated by the ability to track their progress or earn badges. Using these personas to inform the design of the platform can help ensure that it meets the needs and goals of both tutors and learners.
