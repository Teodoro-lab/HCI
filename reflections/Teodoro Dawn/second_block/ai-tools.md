# The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in interface design

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in interface design has given rise to new tools such as Figma to Code, which have received much attention in recent years These AI-driven tools aim to provide an approach so turning design ideas into functional websites or applications is simplified. In my own experience testing Figma to Code, I have found it to be a powerful tool that generates clean, well-structured code that accurately represents the program design in Figma

As highlighted in the findings of Emelie Edberg and Lee Beck, people have their own styles and preferences when it comes to creative work. However, to be effective and meet market demand, the adoption of AI tools in the process can be beneficial. Tools like Figma to Code simplify workflows and save a great deal of time and effort compared to manual coding.


In conclusion, although AI tools like Figma to Code can make the design and development process much more efficient, they do not replace the role of UX designers Deciding on strategies should be left to individuals or companies . AI has definitely affected business processes in the design industry
