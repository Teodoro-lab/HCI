# Understanding the Relationship between HCI and UX

HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and UX (User Experience) share a common goal of designing digital products and services that enhance user satisfaction. As Don Norman, a renowned cognitive scientist, explains: "The real problem with the interface is that it is an interface. Interfaces get in the way. I don't want to focus my energies on an interface. I want to focus on the job."

While HCI focuses on the interaction between humans and computers, UX is concerned with the overall experience that users have while interacting with digital products and services. According to Alan Cooper, a pioneer of interaction design, "User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."

However, there is a fundamental difference between HCI and UX, which is their respective focus. HCI is more technical, concentrating on the efficiency and effectiveness of the digital interfaces, as Steve Krug, an expert in usability testing, emphasizes: "Don't make me think. The more you make users think, the less they'll use your site." On the other hand, UX is more experiential, concentrating on the emotional and psychological aspects of digital interfaces, as Jesse James Garrett, a renowned user experience designer, highlights: "User experience is everything. It always has been, but it's under-valued and under-invested in. If you don't know user-centered design, study it. Hire people who know it. Obsess over it. Live and breathe it. Get your whole company on board."

For instance, a UX feature that could be incorporated into our team's project is a "tutoring search" function that enables students to connect easily with other students willing to tutor them in a specific subject. This feature would include a search function that allows students to find tutors based on specific criteria, such as subject, location, and availability. The feature would also include a messaging system that allows students to communicate with each other and arrange tutoring sessions. Additionally, a rating system that enables students to rate and review their tutors could be incorporated, which helps other students choose the best tutors for their needs. Overall, this feature is designed to make it easy and enjoyable for students to connect with each other and learn from each other, aligning with the UX philosophy of creating interfaces that are delightful, engaging, and meaningful for users.
