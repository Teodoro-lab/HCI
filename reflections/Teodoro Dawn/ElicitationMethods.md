Improving Survey Techniques: Incorporating Standardized Questions and Combining Elicitation Methods

As a member of our team, we utilized interviws as a technique for obtaining info from users on their experience with the mentorships. However, we recognized that the interview questions were not as structured or standardized as they could have been and we could have chosen making polls and surveys in a larger amount o population,that made difficult to compare responses and draw meaningful conclusions. After reviewing literature on survey research methods, we realized that we could consider utilizing structured survey design techniques to ensure more robust results. This could involve the use of standardized questions or scales to collect quantitative data, as suggested by Fowler in "Survey Research Methods" and "Improving Survey Questions: Design and Evaluation."

We learned that standardized questions and scales can ensure that the survey questions are clear and unambiguous, and the responses are comparable across respondents. According to Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski in "The Design of Survey Questions: A Systematic Review," the wording of survey questions is critical for obtaining accurate and reliable data. The use of standardized questions and scales can also help reduce bias and increase the validity and reliability of the survey results.

In addition, from Hox and Roberts in "The Handbook of Survey Research" combining multiple methods of data collection can provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the phenomenon under investigation. While surveys are particularly useful for collecting large-scale data, think-aloud protocols and interviews can provide more detailed and nuanced information about the users' experiences. As such, we realized that we could improve our interviews with survveys and visceversa, by using more structured survey design techniques, such as standardized questions or scales, and considering using other elicitation techniques in combination, such as think-aloud protocols to collect more qualitative and quantitative data.

Overall, we recognized that the interviews and some polls made after provided useful information about the experience of students who have tutored as well as those who have been tutored, such as identifying areas where users had difficulties or where they believed tutoring could be improved. However, we acknowledged that there were limitations to the used technique and that we could improve it by partially following the considerations of the original technique, and considering using other elicitation techniques in combination. By utilizing multiple methods of data collection, we believed that we could obtain a more complete and accurate understanding of students' experiences with tutoring and make more effective improvements.
